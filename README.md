### :pushpin:  “Pokemon game” -  in which given a weighted graph,  a set of “Agents” should be located on it so they could “catch” as many “Pokemons” as possible.
The pokemons are located on the graph’s (directed) edges, therefore, the agent needs to take (aka walk)  the proper edge to “grab” the pokemon
The goal is to maximize the overall sum of weights of the “grabbed” pokemons (while not exceeding the maximum amount of server calls allowed in a second - 10 max)
As part of this project, we can use a data structure and algorithms on graphs (oriented and weighted).

## The algoritm : 
We built an algorithm that works in such a way that we go through all the agents and every agent embedding the Pokemon closest to it, taking into account which Pokemon rib sits on. 
In the edge function – we will check which Pokemon side sits on.
